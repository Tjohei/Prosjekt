For this project we're using the following technologies:

HTML
CSS
Javascript
PHP

----

The website is primarily built using HTML, with CSS for styling and Javascript for dynamically changing the content and rotating the menu.
PHP is only used in contact.php to send an email after a user has filled out the contact form.
If you want to check that this works, fill out the contact form and press submit.
Then you go to "http://www.mailinator.com" and check the inbox of "swinegaimz".

Credits and sources are shown at the bottom of the page, when you hover over "Credits & Sources"

index.html will give an error for "scrolling='no'" in the iframe when running it through the w3 validator, but as of right now there aren't any proper
alternatives that works as intended in all browsers.
